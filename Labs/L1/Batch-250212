Instructions

**I. Data Preparation:**

1.  **Open data file:**  Start by opening the file containing your dataset.
2.  **Load the data:** Read and load the data from the opened file into a suitable data structure (e.g., a Pandas DataFrame).
3.  **Split into Training and Testing sets:** Divide the loaded data into two distinct sets: a training set used to teach the model and a testing set used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

**II. Model Creation and Training:**

4.  **Import Python libraries:** Import the necessary Python libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) that you'll use for neural network creation and manipulation.
5.  **Create an instance of the NN model:** Based on a common template (e.g., VNet, ResNet), create an instance of the chosen neural network architecture. This involves defining the model's layers and structure.
6.  **Train the instance:** Train the created neural network model using the training dataset. This involves feeding the training data to the model and adjusting its parameters to minimize errors.

**III. Model Evaluation:**

7.  **Test the trained model:** After training, evaluate the model's performance on the held-out testing set. This provides an estimate of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
